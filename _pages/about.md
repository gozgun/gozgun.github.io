Hello, I'm Güneş Başak Özgün. I'm a MSc Computer Science and Minor in Management, Technology & Entrepreneurship student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), pursuing my interest in software engineering and product management further. 

I recieved my BSc degree in Mechatronics Engineering and Computer Science & Engineering (double major) from [Sabancı University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/).

As a product enthusiast, I'm driven by the potential of technology to enhance people's lives and empower them to achieve their goals.

With a passion for understanding people and their needs, I thrive on collaborating with diverse teams to create innovative solutions to complex problems. My interdisciplinary background equips me with a broad perspective and a solution-oriented mindset, enabling me to forge effective cross-functional relationships.

If you're looking for a driven, creative, and collaborative product manager who's dedicated to delivering value to customers, I'd love to connect and explore potential opportunities.
