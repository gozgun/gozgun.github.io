Hello, I'm Güneş Başak Özgün. I'm a MSc Computer Science student at EPFL, pursuing my interest in software engineering and product management further. I recieved my BSc degree in Mechatronics Engineering and Computer Science & Engineering (double major) from Sabancı University, Turkey.

I'm motivated by building solutions that will enhance people's lives, creative ideas and working with people from diverse backgrounds.

During my undergraduate studies, I have participated in several projects. Recently I was a part of VIRAL Lab founded by Dr. Onur Varol where I investigated the characteristics of Binaural Music, its different kinds and which parameters define the success (defined as view count on Spotify and wavelenght correctness) of a piece. 
My thesis was on applying of Autoencoder Neural Networks for Computational Fluid Dynamics problems supervised by Prof. Dr. Serhat Yeşilyurt. The model developed calculated the drag force on the wind turbine while reducing the need of computationally expensive simulations.
Additionally, I was a Research Summer Intern at ZoomLab in Carnegie Mellon University. I designed and built a 3D printed prototype boat which moves with Magnetohydrodynamics propulsion. The project was supervised by Dr. Fatma Zeynep Temel.
