Hello, I'm Güneş Başak Özgün. I'm a MSc Computer Science student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), pursuing my interest in software engineering and product management further. I recieved my BSc degree in Mechatronics Engineering and Computer Science & Engineering (double major) from [Sabancı University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/).

I'm motivated by building solutions that will enhance people's lives, creative ideas and working with people from diverse backgrounds.

During my undergraduate studies, I have participated in several projects. Recently I was a part of [VIRAL Lab](http://varollab.com/) founded by [Dr. Onur Varol](http://www.onurvarol.com/) where I analyzed the characteristics of Binaural Music, its different kinds and which parameters define the success (defined as view count on Spotify and wavelenght correctness) of a piece.

My thesis was on applying of Autoencoder Neural Networks for Computational Fluid Dynamics problems supervised by [Prof. Dr. Serhat Yeşilyurt](http://people.sabanciuniv.edu/syesilyurt/). The model developed calculated the drag force on the wind turbine while reducing the need of computationally expensive simulations.

Additionally, I was a Research Summer Intern at [ZoomLab](https://www.zoomlab.ri.cmu.edu/) in [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I designed and built a 3D printed prototype boat which moves with Magnetohydrodynamics propulsion. The project was supervised by [Dr. Fatma Zeynep Temel](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zeynep-temel/).
