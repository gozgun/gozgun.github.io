On this page you can find some of my works that I enjoyed being a part of.

**DISCO - DIStributed COllaborative Learning (2022)**
======

DISCO is developed by Machine Learning and Optimization Lab at EPFL to make these technologies accessible for broad groups of people with its open-source and open-access policy.

As a semester project student in Machine Learning and Optimization Lab at EPFL, I updated the front-end of DISCO to create an intuitive and informative experience for users regardless of their knowledge on machine learning concepts. I used Vue and TypeScript to create a visual identity.

**Cook It Yourself (2021)**

Cook It Yourself is a company idea that I have worked on for two courses: MGMT201 Introduction to Management where I developed the business model and CS308 Software Engineering where this idea was coded into reality. During the project, I have taken roles as Product Owner, ScrumMaster, visual designer and Full Stack Engineer.

In summary Cook It Yourself is an online meal service offering preplanned meals. An order includes a recipe card and the necessary ingredients. Users can review the items they bought, read reviews and find their next meal by filtering their needs.

**HungryDB (2020)**
======
Continuing on with the food theme, this was a CS306 Database Systems course project. This is a website for a users to lookup restaurants, buy a membership to get discounts and rate their restaurant experiences. It was my first time meeting SQL and web development. I worked as an web developer and visual designer.

**Loan Repayment Model (2019)**
======
In this project, the goal was to build a machine learning model to predict if the applicant will pay the loan back or not. We implemented Adaboosted random forest model and PCA for dimensionality reduction. In the end we have obtained F-1 score of 0.80136.

**Hamiltonian Path Problem (2019)**
======
<img style="float: right;" src="/images/hamiltonian.png" alt="Hamiltonian Path" width="150"/>
Although there is not an exact algorithm that solves Hamiltonian path problem in polynomial time, there are some algorithms that finds if the Hamiltonian path exists or not in polynomial time. In this course project for CS301 Algorithms, we analyzed the performance of the modified version of Kruskal algorithm.
